<ExperimentalBlockquote />

With this experimental module, you can interact with files in your k6 scripts. 

The `fs` module is a JavaScript API providing a standard interface to open files, read their content, and seek through them. Compared to the native [open]() function exposed by the k6 core, this module provides a more thorough, asynchronous API, leading to more efficient memory usage overall.

## API

| Interface/Function | Description |
| :----------------- | :---------- |
| [open](/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/open) | opens a file. |
| [File](/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/file) | The File interface is an abstraction to interact with files which exposes read-only operations on files. |

## Example

<CodeGroup labels={["example-fs-modules.js"]} lineNumbers={[]} showCopyButton={[true]}>

```javascript
import { open, SeekMode } from "k6/experimental/fs";

// k6 doesn't support async in the init context. We use a top-level async function for `await`.
//
// Each Virtual User gets its own `file` copy.
// So, operations like `seek` or `read` won't impact other VUs.
let file;
(async function () {
	file = await open("bonjour.txt");
})();

export default async function () {
	// About information about the file
	const fileinfo = await file.stat();
	if (fileinfo.name != "bonjour.txt") {
		throw new Error("Unexpected file name");
	}

	const buffer = new Uint8Array(4);

	let totalBytesRead = 0;
	while (true) {
		// Read into the buffer
		const bytesRead = await file.read(buffer);
		if (bytesRead == null) {
			// EOF
			break;
		}

		// Do something useful with the content of the buffer

		totalBytesRead += bytesRead;

		// If bytesRead is less than the buffer size, we've read the whole file
		if (bytesRead < buffer.byteLength) {
			break;
		}
	}

	// Check that we read the expected number of bytes
	if (totalBytesRead != fileinfo.size) {
		throw new Error("Unexpected number of bytes read");
	}

	// Seek back to the beginning of the file
	await file.seek(0, SeekMode.Start);
}
```
